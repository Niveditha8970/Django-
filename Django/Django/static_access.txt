what are the static files?
=========================
  Static files that don't change when your application is running. these files do a loy
to improve your application, but they aren't dynamically generated by your python web server 
like HTNL response.

How to access static files
==========================
  Generally every server need additional files such as images,javascripts or CSS. In Django, 
we refer to these files as static files. django static files help to manage them.

1.In settings file, define STATIC_URL. example:- STATIC_URL ='static/'

2.In templates, we should use static template tag to build the URL for the given path using the
configured STATICFILE_STORAGE

exaple:- In template file abc.html

{% load static %}
<img src="{% static 'image/img.jpg' %}">

3. Store your static files ina folder called static in our application. 
for exaple:- myapp/static/myapp/example.jpg

4.In our projects will also have assets file.in addition to using a static/ directory 
inside our apps, we can define list of directories(STATICFILES_DIR) in settings file where django
will also look for static files.

for example:-
    STATICFILES_DIRS =[ BASE_DIR / "static", '/var/www/static/', ]
